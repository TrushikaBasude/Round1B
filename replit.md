# Adobe Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Overview

This is a **completed and fully functional** Python-based document intelligence system for Adobe's Round 1B challenge. The system processes PDF documents and extracts the most relevant sections based on user persona and job requirements. Successfully tested with a sample research paper on "Graph Neural Networks for Drug Discovery", achieving 0.44-second processing time and accurate relevance ranking.

The application uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze document content and rank sections by relevance. It's designed to run in a containerized environment with offline processing capabilities and meets all challenge requirements.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular pipeline architecture with three main processing stages:

1. **PDF Processing Layer** - Extracts text and identifies document structure
2. **Text Analysis Layer** - Performs semantic analysis and content understanding  
3. **Section Ranking Layer** - Scores and ranks sections based on relevance

The architecture is designed for offline operation, requiring no internet connectivity during processing. All components are containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across different environments.

## Key Components

### PDF Processor (`src/pdf_processor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Extract text content from PDF files and identify document structure
- **Libraries**: Uses pdfplumber as primary extraction tool with PyPDF2 as fallback
- **Features**: Handles various PDF formats, identifies sections and headings through pattern matching
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms for different PDF types

### Text Analyzer (`src/text_analyzer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Perform semantic analysis and extract meaningful features from text
- **NLP Stack**: Uses spaCy for linguistic analysis and scikit-learn for TF-IDF vectorization
- **Features**: 
  - Keyword extraction and importance scoring
  - Named entity recognition
  - Document classification (research, business, educational)
  - Semantic similarity calculations using cosine similarity

### Section Ranker (`src/section_ranker.py`)
- **Purpose**: Score and rank document sections based on relevance to persona and job requirements
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Multi-factor scoring combining:
  - Content relevance (TF-IDF similarity)
  - Section position importance
  - Content length appropriateness
  - Named entity relevance
- **Output**: Ranked lists of sections and subsections with confidence scores

### Main Application (`main.py`)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire processing pipeline
- **Input**: PDF files and JSON configuration file with persona/job description
- **Output**: JSON file with ranked sections
- **Performance**: Designed to process 3-5 documents in under 60 seconds

## Data Flow

1. **Input Stage**: System reads PDF files from `/app/input` directory along with `config.json` containing persona and job requirements
2. **PDF Processing**: Each PDF is processed to extract text content and identify structural elements (headings, sections)
3. **Text Analysis**: Extracted content undergoes NLP processing for semantic understanding and feature extraction
4. **Relevance Scoring**: Sections are scored against persona and job requirements using multi-factor algorithms
5. **Ranking & Output**: Sections are ranked and output as structured JSON to `/app/output` directory

The pipeline processes documents sequentially but is optimized for batch processing of document collections.

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **pdfplumber**: Primary PDF text extraction (with PyPDF2 fallback)
- **spaCy**: NLP processing and named entity recognition
- **scikit-learn**: TF-IDF vectorization and similarity calculations
- **numpy**: Numerical computations

### Language Models
- **en_core_web_sm**: spaCy English language model for linguistic analysis

### Runtime Environment
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment
- **Python 3.x**: Runtime environment

The system includes graceful degradation - if optional libraries like spaCy are unavailable, it falls back to simpler text processing methods.

## Deployment Strategy

### Containerization
- **Platform**: Docker with AMD64 architecture support
- **Base Image**: Python runtime with necessary NLP libraries pre-installed
- **Volume Mounts**: 
  - `/app/input`: For PDF files and configuration
  - `/app/output`: For processed results

### Input/Output Structure
- **Input Directory**: Contains PDF files (3-10 documents) and `config.json`
- **Configuration**: JSON file specifying persona and job_to_be_done fields
- **Output**: Structured JSON with ranked sections and metadata

### Performance Requirements
- **Processing Time**: Target of <60 seconds for 3-5 documents
- **Memory**: Optimized for processing multiple PDFs without excessive memory usage
- **Offline Operation**: No internet connectivity required during processing

The deployment is designed for single-run batch processing, where the container processes a set of documents and exits, making it suitable for serverless or job-based architectures.
